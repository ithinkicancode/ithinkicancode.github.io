# [Arc of a Journey](https://youtu.be/8hi2K-jLgqc)

Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon,

All my time is in half life,

Memories over memories,

Can I see more than I'm programmed to be?

Constellation of Orion,

A picture with a past, a future so vast,

A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey.

I report there once were cities,

Open academies, avenues and tree,

Human law, automatic oracles,

Calendar, the years, verbal hemispheres.

Constellation of Orion,

The repositioned light, the post-atomic night,

Informing me I'm near the axis of feeling.

Constellation of Orion,

A picture with a past, a future so vast,

A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey.
