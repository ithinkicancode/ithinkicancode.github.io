# Sealed traits in Rust

TILðŸ¦€: Rust has "sealed trait" too!

There isn't a `sealed` keyword in Rust; instead it's a pattern. While its concept is similar to Scalaâ€™s, it serves a different purpose.

In Scala, the `sealed` modifier is used to prevent a class or trait from being extended externally. Its most common use case in Scala 2 is to define enums or ADTs. (Scala 3 has enums.)

In Rust, trait is really synonymous with typeclasss in Haskell and Scala (Iâ€™m going to skip all the glory details for Scala here). And Rust enforces typeclass coherence, which can be summarized as:

A trait can be implemented for a data type as long as either we own the trait or we own the type. In other words, weâ€™re not allowed to implement an external trait (defined elsewhere) for an external type, i.e. we own *neither*.

Sealed traits adds further restriction: traits that are sealed cannot be implemented even when we own the type. The main intention is information hiding, to facilitate future evolutions.

The pattern goes like this:

```rust
pub struct Foo(String);

mod private {
    pub trait SealedMarker {}

    impl SealedMarker for super::Foo {}
}

pub trait TodayILearned: private::SealedMarker {

    fn surprise_me(self) -> String;
}

impl TodayILearned for Foo {
    fn surprise_me(self) -> String {
        self.0.clone()
    }
}
```
